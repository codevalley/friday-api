## Current Focus
Implementing performance tests with the following priorities:
1. Set up load testing infrastructure
2. Define baseline performance metrics

## Testing Strategy
1. Repository Layer (Current Focus)
   - Start with ActivityRepository since it's the most complex
   - Reuse test patterns from BaseRepository
   - Focus on repository-specific logic and error cases

2. Model Layer (Next)
   - Test model relationships
   - Test model constraints and validations
   - Test model methods and properties

3. Service Layer
   - Test business logic
   - Test service-specific validations
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. Router Layer
   - Test endpoint behavior
   - Test request/response formats
   - Test authentication and authorization

## Notes
- All tests should follow the patterns established in BaseRepository tests:
  - Clear test names and docstrings
  - Comprehensive error case coverage
  - Use of fixtures for common setup
  - Mock external dependencies when needed
