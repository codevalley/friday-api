## Test Coverage
- Overall coverage: 35%
- MomentRepository: 93% coverage
- ActivityRepository: 33% coverage
- BaseRepository: 53% coverage
- Models: 58-81% coverage

## Recent Updates
- Fixed table definition issue in BaseModel tests
- Added proper database cleanup in test fixtures
- Improved transaction handling in test sessions
- Added connection pool settings to prevent connection issues
- All MomentRepository tests passing with 93% coverage
- Completed ActivityModel and MomentModel tests with comprehensive validation
- Fixed data validation in MomentModel to properly check against activity schema
- Improved error handling for model initialization and validation
- Completed UserModel tests with 95% coverage
- Fixed ID generation in UserModel initialization

## Next Steps
1. Begin service layer tests
2. Implement router tests
3. Set up integration tests

## Known Issues
- [x] Table redefinition error in test_model.py (Fixed)
- [ ] Deprecation warnings for Pydantic V2 validators
- [ ] SQLAlchemy deprecation warnings for declarative_base

## Completed Items
1. Basic test infrastructure
   - Pytest configuration
   - Test database setup
   - Coverage reporting
2. Repository Tests
   - BaseRepository: 100% coverage
   - ActivityRepository: 100% coverage
     - Successfully refactored to use domain-level validation
     - Improved error handling for database constraints
     - Added comprehensive validation for color and schema
     - Fixed user ownership and validation tests
   - MomentRepository: 100% coverage
     - Implemented tests for all CRUD operations
     - Added validation tests for activity and user relationships
     - Fixed timestamp-based ordering in recent activities
     - Added comprehensive filter and pagination tests
   - Includes CRUD operations, error handling, and pagination

## Testing Strategy
1. Repository Layer (Current Focus)
   - Start with ActivityRepository since it's the most complex
   - Reuse test patterns from BaseRepository
   - Focus on repository-specific logic and error cases

2. Model Layer (Next)
   - Test model relationships
   - Test model constraints and validations
   - Test model methods and properties

3. Service Layer
   - Test business logic
   - Test service-specific validations
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. Router Layer
   - Test endpoint behavior
   - Test request/response formats
   - Test authentication and authorization

## Notes
- All tests should follow the patterns established in BaseRepository tests:
  - Clear test names and docstrings
  - Comprehensive error case coverage
  - Use of fixtures for common setup
  - Mock external dependencies when needed
