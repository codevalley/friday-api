## Current Focus
Implementing MomentService tests with the following priorities:
1. Basic CRUD operations
2. Activity validation
3. Data schema validation
4. Filtering and querying

## Known Issues
- [x] Table redefinition error in test_model.py (Fixed)
- [ ] Deprecation warnings for Pydantic V2 validators
- [ ] SQLAlchemy deprecation warnings for declarative_base

## Completed Items
1. Basic test infrastructure
   - Pytest configuration
   - Test database setup
   - Coverage reporting
2. Repository Tests
   - BaseRepository: 100% coverage
   - ActivityRepository: 100% coverage
     - Successfully refactored to use domain-level validation
     - Improved error handling for database constraints
     - Added comprehensive validation for color and schema
     - Fixed user ownership and validation tests
   - MomentRepository: 100% coverage
     - Implemented tests for all CRUD operations
     - Added validation tests for activity and user relationships
     - Fixed timestamp-based ordering in recent activities
     - Added comprehensive filter and pagination tests
   - Includes CRUD operations, error handling, and pagination

## Testing Strategy
1. Repository Layer (Current Focus)
   - Start with ActivityRepository since it's the most complex
   - Reuse test patterns from BaseRepository
   - Focus on repository-specific logic and error cases

2. Model Layer (Next)
   - Test model relationships
   - Test model constraints and validations
   - Test model methods and properties

3. Service Layer
   - Test business logic
   - Test service-specific validations
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. Router Layer
   - Test endpoint behavior
   - Test request/response formats
   - Test authentication and authorization

## Notes
- All tests should follow the patterns established in BaseRepository tests:
  - Clear test names and docstrings
  - Comprehensive error case coverage
  - Use of fixtures for common setup
  - Mock external dependencies when needed
