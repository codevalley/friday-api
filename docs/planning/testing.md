# Detailed Test Plan for Comprehensive Coverage

## Project Overview

This test plan aims to ensure robust test coverage for all aspects of the project. The goal is to systematically test the application's functionality, performance, and reliability through unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), and performance testing. The plan also integrates CI/CD practices for continuous quality assurance.

---

## Objectives

- Achieve at least 90% test coverage for critical services, models, and repositories.
- Ensure all user flows and edge cases are validated through integration and E2E tests.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the system handles concurrent users efficiently.
- Maintain test reliability by automating test execution and coverage tracking in CI pipelines.

---

## Test Types and Scope

### 1. **Unit Tests**

**Scope**:
- Validate the behavior of individual components, such as repositories, models, and services.
- Focus on isolated tests by mocking dependencies.

**Test Areas**:
- **Repositories**:
  - CRUD operations.
  - Handling invalid inputs and unique constraints.
  - Edge cases for query filters and pagination.
- **Models**:
  - Initialization and relationships (e.g., `Activity` and `Moment` models).
  - JSON schema validation (e.g., `ActivitySchema`).
- **Services**:
  - Business logic validation for `ActivityService`, `MomentService`, and `UserService`.
  - Dependency handling through mocked repositories.

**Examples**:
- Test `MomentService.create_moment` for valid and invalid `activity_id` values.
- Validate schema constraints for the `ActivityModel`.

**Tools**:
- `pytest`
- `unittest.mock`

---

### 2. **Integration Tests**

**Scope**:
- Test interactions between components such as services, repositories, and databases.
- Verify cascading operations and relationships (e.g., deleting an `Activity` removes associated `Moments`).

**Test Areas**:
- **Database Integration**:
  - Validate schema migrations.
  - Test cascading delete behavior.
- **API Interactions**:
  - REST and GraphQL endpoint responses.
  - Validating role-based access and authentication logic.

**Examples**:
- Test `POST /moments` endpoint for correct validation and schema adherence.
- Verify cascading deletion logic between `Activity` and `Moment` models.

**Tools**:
- `pytest`
- `TestClient` from FastAPI

---

### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**

**Scope**:
- Simulate real-world user scenarios to validate the system end-to-end.
- Ensure APIs, databases, and all integrations function as expected under real usage scenarios.

**Test Areas**:
- User registration, authentication, and role-based flows.
- Activity and moment creation, updates, retrieval, and deletion.
- Invalid token handling and permission violations.

**Examples**:
- Simulate a user registering, creating an activity, adding moments, and retrieving data.
- Test boundary cases for authentication token expiration.

**Tools**:
- `TestClient` from FastAPI
- Selenium (if UI testing is needed)

---

### 4. **Performance Tests**

**Scope**:
- Ensure the application performs well under various loads and usage scenarios.
- Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

**Test Areas**:
- Pagination performance for large datasets.
- API response times under concurrent user requests.
- Database query efficiency.

**Examples**:
- Benchmark `GET /activities` endpoint with 1,000 concurrent users.
- Measure query execution time for filtering and sorting operations.

**Tools**:
- Locust
- Apache JMeter

## Coverage Goals

| Component           | Coverage Target |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Repositories        | 95%            |
| Models              | 90%            |
| Services            | 90%            |
| REST/GraphQL APIs   | 85%            |
| End-to-End Scenarios| 80%            |

---

## Test Suite Updates

### Add New Test Files
- **`test_activity_service.py`**: Expand scenarios for JSON schema validation and cascading updates.
- **`test_graphql_queries.py`**: Add comprehensive tests for GraphQL queries and mutations.

### Upgrade Existing Tests
- Include edge cases:
  - Invalid timestamps in `MomentService`.
  - Schema evolution tests for new fields in JSON schemas.

### Automate Coverage Tracking
- Use `pytest-cov` to visualize and track test coverage.

---

## CI/CD Integration

**Setup**:
1. Use GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request.
2. Configure coverage tracking and fail builds if coverage drops below the threshold.
3. Generate performance test reports in CI.

**Sample Workflow**:
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: ./

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install pipenv
          pipenv install --dev
      - name: Run tests
        run: pipenv run pytest --cov=your_module_name
      - name: Upload Coverage
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: coverage-report
          path: htmlcov/
```
