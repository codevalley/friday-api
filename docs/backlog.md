### Milestone 2: Note Processing Integration
**Goal**: Integrate Robo processing into note creation flow

1. Domain Updates
   - [x] Add Robo processing status to NoteData
   - [x] Add validation rules for Robo processing
   - [x] Create RoboProcessingResult value object

2. Service Integration
   - [ ] Update NoteService to use RoboService
     - [x] Decision: Keep NoteService focused on immediate saves

     - [x] Decision: Use Redis-based queue for production
     - [ ] Implement NoteProcessingQueue
     - [ ] Set up worker processes
   - [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
     - [x] Decision: Three-tier error handling (immediate retry, backoff, dead letter)
     - [ ] Implement error hierarchy
     - [ ] Add recovery strategies
     - [ ] Set up monitoring
   - [ ] Add unit tests for new functionality

3. Repository Updates
   - [x] Add temporary status tracking for Robo processing
   - [ ] Implement cleanup mechanism for old processing statuses
   - [ ] Add indices for efficient status queries

### Implementation Details
1. Queue System (Redis-based)
   - [ ] Set up Redis connection management
   - [ ] Implement NoteProcessingQueue class
   - [ ] Create worker process management
   - [ ] Add monitoring and health checks

2. Error Handling
   - [ ] Create error hierarchy
   - [ ] Implement retry strategies
   - [ ] Set up dead letter queue
   - [ ] Add error logging and metrics

3. Processing Flow
   - [ ] Implement state machine for status transitions
   - [ ] Add transaction management
   - [ ] Create cleanup jobs
   - [ ] Set up monitoring

### Milestone 3: Entity Extraction
**Goal**: Implement extraction and linking of moments/activities

1. Core Extraction
   - [ ] Implement moment extraction in RoboService
   - [ ] Implement activity extraction in RoboService
   - [ ] Add validation for extracted entities
   - [ ] Create tests for extraction accuracy

2. Entity Linking
   - [ ] Update MomentService to handle Robo-extracted moments
   - [ ] Update ActivityService to handle Robo-extracted activities
   - [ ] Implement entity deduplication
   - [ ] Add tests for entity linking

### Milestone 4: Infrastructure Hardening
**Goal**: Make the system production-ready

1. Performance & Reliability
   - [ ] Implement response caching
   - [ ] Add circuit breaker for Robo API calls
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for Robo API usage
   - [ ] Add performance tracking metrics

2. Cost Management
   - [ ] Implement token usage tracking
   - [ ] Add cost allocation logging
   - [ ] Create usage reports
   - [ ] Set up usage alerts

### Testing Checklist for Each PR
- [ ] Unit tests for new components
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked Robo responses
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Cost impact assessment

### Notes
- Robo service is internal only, no public API endpoints needed
- Processing status is temporary, no long-term storage in OLTP
- Each milestone should be independently deployable
- Focus on maintaining existing system stability
- Keep changes backward compatible
