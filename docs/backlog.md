Below is a more detailed and prescriptive breakdown of the suggested improvements, tailored for a team with junior developers. Each epic is expanded with explanations, rationale, and optional code snippets showing how to implement the changes. Where possible, specific patterns, naming conventions, and code structure examples are included.

---

## ~~Epic 1: Repository and Interface Consistency~~ ✅

2. ~~**Standardized Pagination:**~~
   - [x] Created `utils/pagination.py` for consistent pagination handling
   - [x] Implemented `skip`/`limit` in repository layer
   - [x] Added conversion utilities for `page`/`size` to `skip`/`limit`
   - [x] Updated all repositories to use standard pagination

3. ~~**Code Organization:**~~

## ~~Epic 5: Code Cleanup & Refactoring~~ ✅

**Goal:** Improve readability, remove unused code, and ensure good performance.

### Tasks & Progress

1. **Code Organization:**
   - [x] Review and clean up imports
   - [x] Remove dead code and unused functions
   - [x] Organize modules logically
   - [x] Add proper docstrings and comments

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - [ ] Optimize database queries
   - [ ] Add appropriate indexes
   - [ ] Implement caching where needed
   - [ ] Profile and optimize slow operations

3. **Testing Improvements:**
   - [ ] Increase test coverage
   - [ ] Add integration tests
   - [ ] Improve test fixtures
   - [ ] Add performance tests

### Detailed Suggestions & Code Snippets

1. **Remove Dead Code:**
   - Search for unused imports and functions with IDE tools.
   - Remove old commented code or redundant functions.

2. **Refine Service Methods:**
   - If a service method is doing too many things (like validating, querying, and transforming data), consider splitting steps into smaller private methods.

   **Before (too many responsibilities):**
   ```python
   def create_activity(self, activity_data):
       self._validate_color(activity_data.color)
       self._validate_activity_schema(activity_data.activity_schema)
       # create activity, convert response, handle pagination??? (not relevant)
   ```

   **After:**
   ```python
   def create_activity(self, activity_data: ActivityData) -> ActivityData:
       validate_color(activity_data.color)
       validate_activity_schema(activity_data.activity_schema)
       created = self.activity_repository.create(...converted from domain...)
       return self._to_domain(created)  # a helper method that converts db model to domain
   ```

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - If `moment_count` column_property is expensive, consider caching or lazy loading.
   - Add appropriate indexes on frequently queried columns (`activity_id`, `user_id`, `timestamp`).
   - Example: If you frequently filter moments by `timestamp`, ensure `timestamp` is indexed in the database.

4. **Documentation & Comments:**
   - Add docstrings explaining the purpose of each method at a high level:

   **Example:**
   ```python
   def create_activity(self, activity_data: ActivityData) -> ActivityData:
       """
       Create a new activity in the database.
       Expects validated ActivityData. Returns the created ActivityData with an assigned ID.
       """
       # Implementation...
   ```

## Next Steps

Based on the completed epics and remaining work, I recommend focusing on Epic 5: Code Cleanup & Refactoring next. This is a good time to improve code quality and performance now that the major architectural changes are complete.

Key tasks to start with:
1. Review and clean up imports across the codebase
2. Remove any dead code or unused functions
3. Add missing docstrings and improve existing ones
4. Begin profiling database queries for optimization

Would you like to start with any of these tasks?
