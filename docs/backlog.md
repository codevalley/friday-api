## LLM Integration Feature Backlog

### Milestone 1: Core LLM Service Infrastructure
**Goal**: Set up base LLM service structure and first implementation

1. Base Infrastructure
   - [ ] Create LLMService interface with core methods
   - [ ] Add LLM-specific error types in domain/exceptions.py
   - [ ] Set up configuration management for LLM API keys
   - [ ] Create basic retry mechanism for API calls

2. OpenAI Implementation
   - [ ] Implement OpenAIService class
   - [ ] Add unit tests with mocked responses
   - [ ] Add integration tests with real API
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting and token tracking

### Milestone 2: Note Processing Integration
**Goal**: Integrate LLM processing into note creation flow

1. Domain Updates
   - [ ] Add LLM processing status to NoteData
   - [ ] Add validation rules for LLM processing
   - [ ] Create LLMProcessingResult value object

2. Service Integration
   - [ ] Update NoteService to use LLMService
   - [ ] Add async processing capability
   - [ ] Implement error handling and recovery
   - [ ] Add unit tests for new functionality

3. Repository Updates
   - [ ] Add temporary status tracking for LLM processing
   - [ ] Implement cleanup mechanism for old processing statuses
   - [ ] Add indices for efficient status queries

### Milestone 3: Entity Extraction
**Goal**: Implement extraction and linking of moments/activities

1. Core Extraction
   - [ ] Implement moment extraction in LLMService
   - [ ] Implement activity extraction in LLMService
   - [ ] Add validation for extracted entities
   - [ ] Create tests for extraction accuracy

2. Entity Linking
   - [ ] Update MomentService to handle LLM-extracted moments
   - [ ] Update ActivityService to handle LLM-extracted activities
   - [ ] Implement entity deduplication
   - [ ] Add tests for entity linking

### Milestone 4: Infrastructure Hardening
**Goal**: Make the system production-ready

1. Performance & Reliability
   - [ ] Implement response caching
   - [ ] Add circuit breaker for LLM API calls
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for LLM API usage
   - [ ] Add performance tracking metrics

2. Cost Management
   - [ ] Implement token usage tracking
   - [ ] Add cost allocation logging
   - [ ] Create usage reports
   - [ ] Set up usage alerts

### Testing Checklist for Each PR
- [ ] Unit tests for new components
- [ ] Integration tests with mocked LLM responses
- [ ] Error handling verification
- [ ] Performance impact assessment
- [ ] Cost impact assessment

### Notes
- LLM service is internal only, no public API endpoints needed
- Processing status is temporary, no long-term storage in OLTP
- Each milestone should be independently deployable
- Focus on maintaining existing system stability
- Keep changes backward compatible
