Below is a detailed, step-by-step plan to revamp the current codebase from the `Book`/`Author` domain to the `Moment`/`Activity` domain for your life logging application. This plan aims to maintain the project's clean architecture principles while introducing the new domain concepts of `Moment` and `Activity`. It also provides guidance on updating tests, documentation, configuration, and ensuring a smooth transition over the next few months.

---

## High-Level Objectives

1. **Domain Shift**: Replace the current domain (Books, Authors, BookAuthor) with the new domain (Moments, Activities).
2. **Data Model Changes**: Introduce `Moment` and `Activity` models that reflect the `domain-models.md` document. Replace relational fields with suitable references for the new domain.
3. **Schema & Validation**: Update Pydantic and GraphQL schemas to reflect the new entities (`Moment` and `Activity`), including validation logic for JSON data structures defined by `Activity`.
4. **Services & Business Logic**: Refactor services to implement the rules and logic for `Moment` creation, listing, filtering by `Activity`, JSON data validation, and so forth.
5. **Routers & Endpoints**: Update all REST and GraphQL endpoints from `book`/`author` to `moment`/`activity`. Introduce endpoints to filter moments by time, list activities, and perform data validation.
6. **Testing**: Update unit, integration, and acceptance tests to reflect the new entities, new endpoints, and new validation rules.
7. **Documentation**: Update all documentation (READMEs, `.md` docs in `docs/`) to reflect the life logging domain, activity schemas, and the new API contracts.
8. **Incremental & Safe Migration**: Approach changes in phases to ensure stability, with continuous testing after each phase.

## Detailed Phased Plan

### Phase 1: Preparatory Work 

**Goals**:  
- Understand existing code thoroughly.
- Identify dependencies between layers (models → services → routers → tests).

**Actions**:  
1. **Precheck**: 
   - Environment setup completed with required variables
   - MySQL database configuration identified
   - Initial codebase structure analyzed

2. **Review Domain Docs**: 
   - Confirmed final structure of `Moment` and `Activity` from `domain-models.md`
   - Required fields for `Moment` noted:
     - `id`, `timestamp` (UTC), `activity_id`, `data` (JSON)
   - Required fields for `Activity` noted:
     - `id`, `name`, `description`, `activity_schema` (JSON), `icon`, `color`

3. **Check Database Constraints**: 
   - Current DB tables: `books`, `authors`, `book_author_association`
   - Future DB tables: `moments`, `activities`
   - No deployment concerns as this is a new project

### Phase 2: Data Model Migration

(Adjust as needed based on development pace and unforeseen complexities.)

---

## Key Considerations

- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after each major change to ensure no regressions.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Test changes in a staging environment before production.
- **Rollout**: Once stable and tested, merge `feature/lifelogging-revamp` into the main branch.

## Conclusion

This plan provides a thorough blueprint for transforming the existing codebase into a robust life logging system aligned with the `Moment` and `Activity` domain. Following these steps will help maintain architectural integrity, ensure code quality, and guide your development efforts over the coming months.
