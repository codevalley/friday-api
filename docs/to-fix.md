Below are detailed observations, corrections, and discrepancies found during the review. This includes technical and logical issues, inconsistencies between layers, and deviations from the `friday-revamp.md` plan.

## High-Level Findings

1. **[✓] Legacy Domain Code Cleanup**:  
   - [x] Removed all Book/Author models
   - [x] Removed repositories and services
   - [x] Removed routers and schemas
   - [x] Kept test files for reference
   - [x] Verified main.py uses only new domain
   - [x] Verified GraphQL schemas use only new domain

2. **Inconsistent Data Types Between Layers**:  
   GraphQL schemas (`Activity.py` and `Moment.py`) expect `activity_schema` and `data` as strings (JSON serialized), whereas Pydantic and DB layers handle them as Python dictionaries. For example:
   - `schemas/graphql/Activity.py` and `schemas/graphql/Moment.py` use `str` for `activity_schema` and `data`.
   - `ActivityModel` and `MomentModel` store `activity_schema` and `data` as JSON (dict) in the database.
   - `ActivityResponse` and `MomentResponse` Pydantic schemas also treat these fields as `Dict`.

   **Fix**: 
   - Decide on a consistent format. If GraphQL expects a JSON string, serialize (`json.dumps`) the dict fields before returning data in resolvers/services.
   - Alternatively, modify the GraphQL schema to return these fields as `JSON` scalars (if supported) or ensure the code converts dict → string before returning.

3. **Mismatch Between Documentation and Code**:  
   Some docs (e.g., `application-services.md`) show async methods while the final code is mostly synchronous. The final code uses synchronous SQLAlchemy sessions and no `async`/`await` in services. This is not necessarily wrong, but it's inconsistent with the planned asynchronous architecture.

   **Fix**: 
   - Either update the documentation to reflect the synchronous implementation
   - Or implement async database operations using SQLAlchemy async session

4. **Pending Code Cleanup Steps**:
   - Remove any remaining references to `fastapi-example`
   - Update all documentation to reflect new domain
   - Ensure consistent naming across codebase

## Next Steps
1. Address data type inconsistencies between layers
2. Update documentation to match implementation
3. Add comprehensive tests for new domain
4. Review and optimize database queries
