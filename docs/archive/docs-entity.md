# Document Management System

This document outlines the implementation approach for the Document Management System, which will handle document storage, retrieval, and metadata management in our application.

## Key Design Decisions [COMPLETED ✓]

### Storage Abstraction [COMPLETED ✓]
- [x] Implement a storage abstraction layer to decouple storage implementation from business logic
- [x] Support multiple storage backends (local filesystem initially, cloud storage in future)
- [x] Use URL-based addressing for document locations
- [x] Handle storage operations asynchronously when appropriate

### Document States [COMPLETED ✓]
```python
class DocumentStatus(str, Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"      # Document is being uploaded
    ACTIVE = "active"        # Document is available
    ARCHIVED = "archived"    # Document is archived (soft-deleted)
    ERROR = "error"          # Error in document processing
```

### Storage Interface [COMPLETED ✓]
```python
class StorageBackend(Protocol):
    async def store(self, file: UploadFile, user_id: str) -> str:
        """Store a file and return its URL"""
        ...

    async def retrieve(self, url: str, user_id: str) -> BytesIO:
        """Retrieve a file by its URL"""
        ...

    async def delete(self, url: str, user_id: str) -> None:
        """Delete a file"""
        ...
```

## Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Core Document Entity [COMPLETED ✓]

3. [x] Add storage configuration
   - [x] Environment variable support
   - [x] Factory pattern for backend creation
   - [x] Testing utilities
4. [x] Integrate with document metadata

- Security measures in place
- Performance optimizations

### Minor Pending Items (Optional Enhancements)
1. Additional Storage Backends
   - [ ] Azure Blob Storage integration
   - [ ] Google Cloud Storage integration
2. Advanced Features
